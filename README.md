# OpenErgMonitor-
Smartphone based open source rowing ergometer monitor

This project aims to create digital monitor for a rowing ergmeter that is as cheap as possible and open source. This aims to complement Fim Flood's excelent "Open Ergo" (see here: openergo.webs.com), which currently is difficult to use, despite a good "feeling" because of the lack of feedback and motivation that the monitor provides. 

In order to keep costs down, the monitor will ran on a Smartphone (Android for starters) and preferably require as little as possible of external sensors and dedicated control boards. 

The project breaks down into two components: (a) hardware: measuring the accelerations and decelerations of the fan (disc, flywheel) of the rower with sufficient precision and comunicating that to the smartphone (b) software: from the changes in fan speed deduct all the relevant information for a rowing erg monitor (stroke rate, power (watts, split), displacement, etc)

## Hardware: Measuring the speed of the fan preciselly
