# OpenErgMonitor-
Smartphone based open source rowing ergometer monitor

This project aims to create digital monitor for a rowing ergmeter that is as cheap as possible and open source. 

The open monitor should to complement Fim Flood's excelent [openergo.webs.com]("Open Ergo"  project), which gives detailed plans for building a DIY erg with simple and available materials. The idea is to create a viable anternative to expensive comercial ergometers, such as Concept2 and RowPerfect, especially in developing countries. Unfortunatelly, despite a good "feeling" of the DIY machine, lack of feedback and motivation from a monitor greatly reduces the potential uses. So a DIY monitor is needed. 

In order to keep costs down, the monitor will ran on a Smartphone (Android for starters) and preferably require as little as possible of external sensors and dedicated control boards. 

The project breaks down into two components: (a) hardware: measuring the accelerations and decelerations of the fan (disc, flywheel) of the rower with sufficient precision and comunicating that to the smartphone (b) software: from the changes in fan speed deduct all the relevant information for a rowing erg monitor (stroke rate, power (watts, split), displacement, etc)

## Hardware: Measuring the speed of the fan preciselly

I have been asking about this at some forums, and got some very interesting feedback. Links are listed bellow

## Software: 

Software part consist of receving the stream speed measurements and extracting the relevant information on stroke rate, power, displacement, etc). This should be an app that, developed for Android, and preferably compatible, as much as possible, with older android versions.
